## About
I started developing iObjects in 2002 when I was decided to migrate from Win32/Delphi universe to the Web/Java/HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack. A few years before, in 1998, I have developed a pretty amazing framework with Delphi which was the foundation I have used to develop a best seller ERP solution. That time, my company got several great clients and we have grow from 2 to 20 developers in just a few months. The great news is that the ERP quality wasn't affected at all, even we having hired only interns. So, I was decided to replicate that success, but leaving Windows behind. Between 2002 and 2008, the now entitled iObjects had a few different names and was used as foundation to develop several information systems, to address several different problems, for several different companies. And in 2008 it got its current name and shape.
