## About

### The story behind

I started developing iObjects in 2002 when I was decided to migrate from Win32/Delphi universe to the Web/Java/HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack. A few years before, in 1998, I have developed a pretty amazing framework with Delphi which was the foundation I have used to develop a best seller ERP solution. That time, my company got several great clients and we have grow from 2 to 20 developers in just a few months. The great news is that the ERP quality wasn't affected at all, even we having hired only interns. So, I was decided to replicate that success, but leaving Windows behind. 

Between 2002 and 2008, this framework had a few different names and was used as foundation to develop dozens of information systems, to address several different problems, for several different companies. In 2008, it got its current name and shape. It's now made of 500K+ lines of codes and comments which, by the way, have been written by my two hands. As I can remember, the only third party component inside iObjects is the great [Highcharts](http://highcharts.com), which I haven't included in any of these previous countings.

My only regret about iObjects is not have understanding [Silvio Meira](https://twitter.com/srlm)'s advice to make it open source. While I'm writing these lines, I can see before my eyes names of great frameworks and I can't stop wondering: what if I had done that? I'm really sorry for being late, but perhaps some software architecture students may take advantage of any of my ideas and take it to a new level. Perhaps.
